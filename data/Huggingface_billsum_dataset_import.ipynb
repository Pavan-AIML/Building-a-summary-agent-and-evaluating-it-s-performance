Many California communities, however, lack equitable access to parks and other open-space areas. This lack of access to the outdoors contributes to higher incidences of certain health ailments, such as diabetes, hypertension,\\nobesity,\\nand nature deficit disorder, and other negative social indicators, especially in low-income communities.\\n(2) According to the recent Parks Forward Commission report,\\nreleased in February 2015,\\nimproving access to parks, outdoor experiences, and recreational opportunities, particularly for youth and young adults in disadvantaged communities, will lead to more healthy lifestyles, better educational outcomes, and improvements to the overall well-being of\\nCalifornia citizens,\\nCalifornia’s citizens\\nand\\ncommunities,\\nand\\nas well as\\nour natural environment.\\n(3)\\nThe Legislature enacted\\nChapter 663 of the Statutes of\\n2003, which\\n2003\\nestablished the Outdoor Environmental Education Program and required a study on the benefits of outdoor environmental education for at-risk youth and underserved demographic groups. The study found that the science test scores of children who participated in the program were raised by 27 percent, and that these children also had improved conflict resolution and problem solving skills, better self-esteem, and were more motivated to learn. The program ended on July 1, 2005.\\n(4)\\nThe Legislature enacted\\nResolution Chapter 101 of the Statutes of\\n2006, which\\n2006\\nrecognized the importance of local recreational and park agencies in the effort to reverse negative trends in inactivity, obesity, diabetes, and other health problems among Californians and encouraged the state to use, and partner with, local recreation and park providers to create a healthier state.\\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to expand access to parks and other outdoor educational and recreational opportunities in underserved areas by, among other things, convening and developing strategic partnerships to facilitate, promote, and enhance access to parks, as well as outdoor educational and recreational experiences in underserved communities.\\nSEC. 2.\\nChapter 14 (commencing with Section 5880) is added to Division 5 of the Public Resources Code, to read:\\nCHAPTER  14.
