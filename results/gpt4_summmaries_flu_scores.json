These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.\n(2) These veterans\u2019 organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.\n(b) As a result of congressional chartering of these veterans\u2019 organizations, the United States Internal Revenue Service created a special tax exemption for these organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n(c) Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that, among other attributes, carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, conducts programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, sponsors or participates in activities of a patriotic nature, and provides social and recreational activities for their members.\n(d) Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that uildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans\u2019 organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, and exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, shall be exempt from taxation.\n(b) The exemption provided for in this section shall apply to the property of all organizations meeting the requirements of this section, subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, and paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 214.\n(c) (1) The exemption specified by subdivision (a) shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes.\n(2) With regard to this subdivision, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n(A) The exempt activities of a veterans\u2019 organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans\u2019 organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.\n(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans\u2019 organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization\u2019s exempt purposes and activities.\n(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans\u2019 organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.\n(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. .",

The bill would also provide that the exemption shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served.\nSection 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.",
